### Get STARTED


To get started first you have to install json-server globally

"npm install -g json-server"

Inside project folder where catalog.json exists run command(By using JSON server we are faking the API call).

"json-server --p 5555 catalog.json"

"npm i"

We are now good to run the project by "npm start"
